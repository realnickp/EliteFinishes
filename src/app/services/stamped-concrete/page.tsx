        "If you love the look of natural stone but not the price tag, stamped concrete is your answer. With dozens of patterns and color combinations available — from Ashlar slate to cobblestone to herringbone brick — stamped concrete gives you the rich, textured appearance of premium materials at 30–50% less cost. And unlike individual pavers that can shift and grow weeds between joints, stamped concrete is a single monolithic slab that stays locked in place.",
        "Backyard Bobby's has been pouring and stamping decorative concrete across Anne Arundel County for years. We've installed stamped patios in Annapolis, pool decks in Severna Park, and walkways in Crofton — each one custom-designed with patterns and integral colors chosen to complement the homeowner's property. Our finishing techniques create surfaces that guests genuinely can't tell apart from real stone.",
        "The key to stamped concrete that lasts in Maryland's climate is in the details that most contractors rush through: proper sub-base preparation, the right concrete mix design for our freeze-thaw cycles, precise timing on the stamp application, and a professional-grade sealer that protects color and resists moisture penetration. That's what you get with Backyard Bobby's.",

          question: "How does stamped concrete compare to pavers in terms of cost?",
          answer:
            "Stamped concrete typically costs $12–$22 per square foot installed, while paver patios run $15–$30+ per square foot. For larger areas, the savings with stamped concrete can be significant — a 400-square-foot patio could save you $2,000–$4,000 compared to a comparable paver installation.",

          question: "Will stamped concrete crack in Maryland winters?",
          answer:
            "All concrete can develop hairline cracks over time, but we minimize this risk with air-entrained concrete mixes designed for freeze-thaw, fiber mesh reinforcement, and strategically placed control joints that are hidden within the stamp pattern. Properly installed stamped concrete holds up extremely well in Maryland's climate.",

          question: "How often does stamped concrete need to be resealed?",
          answer:
            "We recommend resealing every 2–3 years to maintain the color vibrancy and surface protection. It's a straightforward process — a good cleaning followed by a fresh coat of sealer — and we're happy to do it for you or show you how to handle it yourself.",

        {
          question: "Can stamped concrete be slippery when wet?",
          answer:
            "The stamped texture itself provides good traction, but sealed surfaces can be slick when wet. For pool decks and high-traffic walkways, we add a non-slip additive to the sealer that provides grip without changing the appearance. This is standard on all our pool deck projects.",

          answer:
            "Ashlar slate and random stone patterns are our most requested — they pair beautifully with both colonial and modern-style homes common in Annapolis, Severna Park, and Arnold. For a more traditional look, running bond brick and cobblestone are popular choices. We bring physical samples to your consultation so you can see and feel the texture.",
