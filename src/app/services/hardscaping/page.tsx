        "Your backyard should be more than just grass and a garden hose. A well-designed hardscape turns wasted yard space into an outdoor living area you'll actually use — for morning coffee, weekend cookouts, or just unwinding after a long day. At Backyard Bobby's, we specialize in building patios, walkways, retaining walls, outdoor kitchens, and fire pits that look stunning and stand up to everything Anne Arundel County's climate throws at them.",
        "Maryland's freeze-thaw cycles, clay-heavy soils, and summer downpours demand more than a quick paver job. We engineer every project with proper excavation depth, compacted aggregate bases, and drainage solutions designed specifically for local soil conditions. That's the difference between a patio that shifts and cracks in two years and one that looks perfect a decade later.",
        "Whether you're envisioning a natural stone walkway to your front door, a multi-level paver patio with a built-in fire pit, or a retaining wall that tames a sloped yard and adds usable square footage, we handle the entire project in-house — from design through final installation. No subcontractors, no runaround.",

          question: "How long does a typical patio installation take in Anne Arundel County?",
          answer:
            "Most residential patio projects take 5–10 working days depending on size and complexity. A simple 200-square-foot patio might be done in a week, while a multi-level design with a fire pit or outdoor kitchen could take two weeks. Weather and permit timelines can also factor in.",

          question: "Will pavers shift or crack with Maryland's freeze-thaw cycles?",
          answer:
            "Not when installed correctly. We excavate to the proper depth for Anne Arundel County's clay soil, install 6–8 inches of compacted aggregate base, and use polymeric sand in the joints. Pavers are actually more freeze-thaw resistant than poured concrete because the joints allow slight flex without cracking.",

          question: "What's the difference between pavers and natural stone?",
          answer:
            "Concrete pavers are manufactured, consistent in size, and available in a huge range of colors and patterns — they're typically more budget-friendly. Natural stone (flagstone, bluestone, travertine) offers a unique, high-end look but costs more and requires more skilled installation. We work with both and can help you decide based on your budget and aesthetic goals.",

          question: "Do I need a permit for a patio or retaining wall in Anne Arundel County?",
          answer:
            "Patios at ground level generally don't require a permit, but retaining walls over 4 feet tall and any project near the Critical Area (within 1,000 feet of the Chesapeake Bay or its tributaries) typically do. We handle all permit applications and know the county requirements inside and out.",
        },
        {
          question: "How much does hardscaping cost per square foot?",
          answer:
            "Paver patios typically range from $15–$30 per square foot installed, depending on the material and design complexity. Natural stone runs $25–$50+. Retaining walls are priced per square face foot and range from $25–$60 depending on material. We provide detailed, itemized estimates so you know exactly where every dollar goes.",

            "Absolutely — that's one of our specialties. We use retaining walls, terraced levels, and proper grading to create flat, usable patio spaces on sloped properties. Many of our best projects in Severna Park and Arnold involve working with the natural grade to create multi-level outdoor living areas.",
