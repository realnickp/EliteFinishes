        "An accessory dwelling unit is one of the smartest investments a Maryland homeowner can make. Whether you need a private space for aging parents, a rental unit that generates monthly income, or a detached home office that actually feels separate from your house, a well-built ADU adds square footage and real value to your property. In Anne Arundel County—where housing demand stays strong year-round—a quality ADU can pay for itself faster than almost any other home improvement.",
        "At Backyard Bobby's, we design and build ADUs from the ground up. We handle the full scope: architectural planning, county permits, excavation, foundation, framing, roofing, electrical, plumbing, and finish work. You get one licensed contractor managing the entire project instead of juggling five different subs. That means fewer delays, clearer communication, and a final product that actually matches what you were promised.",
        "Maryland updated its ADU regulations to make it easier for homeowners to add these units, and Anne Arundel County has its own set of zoning requirements around setbacks, size limits, and utility connections. We stay current on every rule so your project sails through the permitting process without surprises. If you've been thinking about an ADU, a quick conversation with our team will tell you exactly what's possible on your lot.",

          question: "Does Anne Arundel County allow accessory dwelling units?",
          answer:
            "Yes. Maryland passed legislation encouraging ADU construction, and Anne Arundel County allows them on qualifying residential lots. Specific rules around lot size, setbacks, and maximum square footage vary by zoning district. We review your parcel's eligibility during the free consultation.",

          question: "How much does it cost to build an ADU in Maryland?",
          answer:
            "Most ADU projects in Anne Arundel County range from $100,000 to $250,000 depending on size, finishes, and whether you need new utility connections. We provide a detailed written estimate after the on-site consultation so you know exactly what to expect before committing.",

          question: "How long does an ADU build take from start to finish?",
          answer:
            "A typical ADU takes 4 to 6 months from permit approval to move-in. Permitting itself can take 4 to 8 weeks depending on the county's review queue. We give you a project timeline during the planning phase and keep you updated weekly throughout construction.",

          question: "Can I rent out my ADU?",
          answer:
            "In most Anne Arundel County zoning districts, yes. Some areas have owner-occupancy requirements, meaning you need to live in either the main house or the ADU. We'll clarify the rental rules that apply to your specific property during our initial visit.",
        },
        {
          question: "Do I need a separate address and utility meters for the ADU?",
          answer:
            "It depends on the county's requirements and how you plan to use the unit. Some homeowners share utilities with the main house; others install separate meters for easier billing. We help you decide the best approach and coordinate with BGE and the county water authority.",

        {
          question: "Will building an ADU increase my property taxes?",
          answer:
            "Adding livable square footage will likely increase your assessed value, which can raise property taxes. However, the rental income or added equity typically far outweighs the tax increase. We recommend talking to your accountant for specific numbers.",
