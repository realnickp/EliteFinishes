          question: "How do I know if my roof needs repair or a full replacement?",
          answer:
            "As a rule of thumb, if your roof is under 15 years old and the damage is localized (a few missing shingles, a small leak around a pipe boot), a repair is usually the right call. If your roof is 20+ years old, has widespread granule loss, curling shingles, or multiple leak points, a full replacement is almost always more cost-effective than patching. We'll give you an honest recommendation either way.",

          question: "How long does a roof replacement take?",
          answer:
            "Most residential roof replacements are completed in 1–3 days depending on the size of the home, weather conditions, and whether any decking needs to be replaced. We never leave your home exposed overnight — if we start a tear-off, we finish or secure the area with tarps before we leave.",

          question: "What type of shingles do you recommend for homes near the Chesapeake Bay?",
          answer:
            "For coastal Anne Arundel County homes, we typically recommend architectural shingles rated for 130+ mph winds with algae-resistant granules to combat the humidity. GAF Timberline HDZ and CertainTeed Landmark are two of our go-to products. For areas prone to hail, we can upgrade to impact-resistant Class 4 shingles.",
