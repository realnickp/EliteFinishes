const FINANCING_FAQS = [
  {
    question: "How does Wisetack financing work for home improvement projects?",
    answer:
      "Wisetack offers fixed-rate installment loans for home improvement projects. You prequalify in minutes with a soft credit check that doesn't affect your score. If approved, you choose a payment plan (typically 3–60 months), and Backyard Bobby's gets paid directly so your project starts immediately. You make fixed monthly payments to Wisetack — no balloon payments, no prepayment penalties.",
  },
  {
    question: "What credit score do I need to qualify for Wisetack financing?",
    answer:
      "Wisetack considers multiple factors beyond just your credit score, including income and debt-to-income ratio. There's no minimum score published, but the soft prequalification check takes about 30 seconds and tells you your options without any impact to your credit. If you prequalify, a hard credit check only happens when you formally accept a loan offer.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does prequalifying affect my credit score?",
    answer:
      "No. Wisetack uses a soft credit check for prequalification, which does not appear on your credit report and has zero impact on your score. A hard inquiry only occurs if you decide to accept a loan offer and move forward.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the interest rates and loan terms?",
    answer:
      "Wisetack offers rates as low as 0% APR for qualified borrowers. Terms range from 3 to 60 months depending on the loan amount and your credit profile. Loan amounts range from $500 to $25,000. You'll see your exact rate, monthly payment, and total cost before you commit to anything.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I finance a deck, patio, or driveway project in Anne Arundel County?",
    answer:
      "Yes — every outdoor construction service we offer is eligible for Wisetack financing. That includes decks, patios, hardscaping, fencing, driveways, stamped concrete, gravel pads, roofing, excavation, and accessory dwelling units. There's no restriction on project type.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does Backyard Bobby's require upfront?",
    answer:
      "For projects paid in full or by card, we never ask for more than 50% upfront — the balance is due at completion. With Wisetack financing, the lender pays us directly, so you may have zero out-of-pocket upfront depending on your loan terms. We discuss payment structure during your free estimate.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a penalty for paying off the loan early?",
    answer:
      "No. Wisetack loans have no prepayment penalties. You can pay off your balance early at any time without additional fees.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer financing for projects over $25,000?",
    answer:
      "Wisetack loans go up to $25,000, which covers the majority of our projects. For larger projects like ADUs or major hardscaping renovations, we can structure milestone-based payment schedules and discuss additional financing partners. Ask us during your estimate and we'll find a solution that works.",
